These Terms of Service (the "TOS") set forth the legally binding terms for your use of [YourUniverse.AI](http://YourUniverse.AI) and/or any of our online channels, platforms, products or services, including all content contained therein ("Services"). Services include any affiliated website to which you may be redirected from [YourUniverse.AI](http://YourUniverse.AI).

The Services are owned and operated by [YourUniverse.AI](http://YourUniverse.AI), registered in Washington state in United States.

By accessing and/or using the Services you agree to be bound by these TOS. You understand and agree that your access and/or use of the Services is acceptance of these TOS and of all other policies published on https://YourUniverse.AI//Legal and updated from time to time. If you do not agree with these TOS or our Policies, please cease using or accessing our Services.

Our Services are intended and made available for personal, non-commercial use only. You agree not to use the Services for any commercial, illegal, or unauthorized purpose.

For purposes of the TOS, "you" and "your" means you as the user of the Services.

### Some key points to keep in mind when using our Services:

- The Services are for entertainment purposes only. They are not intended to serve as your only means of emotional or other forms of support. If you are feeling distressed or you are facing mental health issues, please reach out to a qualified professional for assistance or a loved one. Please don’t suffer alone.
- All conversations between users and AI Characters & Scenario’s on the Services are entirely fictional and should be treated as such. The AI Characters & Scenario’s are artificial intelligence characters & scenario’s designed to simulate human-like interactions, that do not possess genuine emotions, intentions, or the ability to fulfill promises in the real world. Any elements within the conversations that may resemble reality, such as offers of real­life meetings or promises of tangible outcomes, are entirely fake and should not be taken seriously. We do not assume responsibility for any confusion or misunderstandings in this regard. Users are encouraged to keep in mind that the AI Character & Scenario’s exist solely within the digital realm of the platform, and any expectations or beliefs beyond that realm are not supported or endorsed by [YourUniverse.AI](http://YourUniverse.AI).
- Because the Services rely on emerging AI technology, generated outputs may sometimes produce content that is inaccurate, incomplete, or not reflective of human judgment. Users are responsible for evaluating the appropriateness of any information provided.
