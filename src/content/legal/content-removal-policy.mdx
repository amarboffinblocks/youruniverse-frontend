At [YourUniverse.AI](http://youruniverse.ai/) we strive to maintaining a safe and respectful experience of all our users.
Our Content Removal Policy outlines our approach to addressing concerns related to content
that may inadvertently resemble real individuals. All content accessible on [YourUniverse.AI](http://youruniverse.ai/)
and/or any of our online channels, affiliated websites to which you may be redirected from
[YourUniverse.AI](http://youruniverse.ai/), platforms, products or services, including all content contained therein
("Services") is generated exclusively through artificial intelligence technology, allowing users to
create and interact with AI-generated characters. Any similarity to actual persons is
unintentional and purely coincidental.

## Unintentional Resemblance to Actual Persons

Content on the Services is AI-generated. However, where AI-generated content unintentionally
resembles actual persons, we are dedicated to promptly addressing the issue and/or any
concerns.

actual person, they can request its removal by contacting our support team at
[support@youruniverse.ai](mailto:support@youruniverse.ai) or directly report their concern in the “Contact Us” area in the
Services. We will thoroughly review the request and take appropriate action within a
reasonable timeframe.

## User Verification

To ensure the accuracy and legitimacy of content removal requests, we may request the user
to provide adequate evidence of their identity or relationship to the person depicted in the
content. This verification process is implemented to responsibly handle requests and
safeguard the rights and interests of all users.

## Content Removal

Upon verification and confirmation of a valid content removal request, the specified content
will be removed in a timely manner from the Services. Our goal is to complete this process
promptly while ensuring compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

## Privacy

We respect user privacy throughout the entire content removal process. All requests are
treated strictly confidential, and we do not disclose any personal information or details of the
requests to any third parties without explicit consent, unless required by law.
